  question: "What is the best self-hosted or on-premise Trello alternative?",
  title: "Self-hosted, on-premise Trello alternatives (2026)",
  description:
    "Trello is cloud only, with no on-premise edition. Six open-source kanban boards you can self-host instead, compared on licence, single sign-on, and upkeep.",
  summary:
    "Trello has no on-premise edition. Here are the boards that do, and their catches.",
  answer:
    "Trello has no self-hosted edition, so a self-hosted Trello alternative means switching tools. Kaneo, PLANKA, WeKan, Kanboard, and Vikunja are the main options. Kaneo is MIT licensed with single sign-on and a backlog in the free build, PLANKA is closest to Trello's card design but keeps SSO for its paid tier, and WeKan and Kanboard are the most minimal.",

      body: [
        "Trello exports each board to JSON from the board menu on every plan, including cards, lists, labels, and members. Comments come from the 1,000 most recent actions only, so older history on a busy board may be missing. Attachments are links rather than files, so download them separately if they matter.",
        "From there it is a scripting job against the target tool's API. Kaneo has a documented public API and per-project JSON import, so a board of a few hundred cards is an afternoon. Import into a scratch project first and check assignee matching, which usually happens by email address.",
