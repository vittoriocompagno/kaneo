  question: "What are the best free, open-source Jira alternatives?",
  title: "Free, open-source Jira alternatives compared (2026)",
  description:
    "Jira is not open source and costs money to self-host. Five free, open-source alternatives you can run yourself, compared on licence, single sign-on, and fit.",
  summary:
    "Five self-hostable trackers that replace Jira, and the Jira features none of them have.",
  answer:
    "Jira is not open source, and self-hosting it means a paid Data Center subscription. The realistic free, open-source Jira alternatives are Kaneo, Plane, OpenProject, Redmine, and Taiga. Kaneo is the lightest and is MIT licensed with single sign-on included, Plane is closest in interface to a modern tracker, OpenProject is closest to Jira in scope, Redmine has the deepest plugin ecosystem, and Taiga is the strongest for Scrum. None of them replicate Jira's schemes, marketplace, or Jira Service Management.",

Jira is built so a 500-person organisation can encode its process, and that same machinery is overhead for a team of eight.",
        "The second reason is hosting. Atlassian ended new Jira Server sales, so running Jira on your own hardware means Jira Data Center, priced by user tier as an annual subscription. For teams whose reason for self-hosting is cost or data control, that is the wrong end of the deal.",
        "The third is pricing shape. Jira Cloud is free up to 10 users, then per user, with SAML single sign-on needing an Atlassian Guard subscription or the Enterprise tier. Small teams cross that line quickly.",

      question: "Is Jira open source?",
      answer:
        "No. Jira is proprietary, closed-source software from Atlassian, sold as Jira Cloud and as a self-managed Jira Data Center subscription. If you need a tracker whose code you can read, change, and run for free, you need one of the open-source alternatives above.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best free Jira alternative?",
      answer:
        "For a free, self-hosted tool, Kaneo is the lightest to run and the only option here with OIDC single sign-on in the free build. Taiga is the strongest for Scrum, OpenProject the closest to Jira in scope, and Plane the closest to a modern hosted tracker.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free version of Jira?",
      answer:
        "Jira Cloud has a free tier for up to 10 users with limits on storage and automation. Beyond that it is priced per user, and SAML single sign-on needs an Atlassian Guard subscription or the Enterprise tier. Self-hosting means Jira Data Center, which is a paid annual subscription.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Jira be self-hosted for free?",
      answer:
        "No. Jira Server is discontinued for new customers and Data Center is a paid subscription sized by user tier. If free self-hosting is the requirement, you need an open-source tracker.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the closest open-source tool to Jira?",
      answer:
        "OpenProject, in scope and structure. If what you liked about Jira was the board and backlog rather than the schemes and reports, Kaneo or Plane will feel closer to what you actually used.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a Jira migration take?",
      answer:
        "For a small team with a handful of projects, a day of scripting and a weekend of parallel running. The variables are attachment volume, comment history, and how many custom fields you decide to carry across rather than drop.",
