  subheading:
    "Trello nails simple kanban, but your boards live on someone else's servers and grow into paid Power-Ups. Kaneo keeps the simplicity, adds backlog and workflows, and lets you own the whole thing.",
  verdict:
    "Kaneo is a self-hostable, MIT-licensed Trello alternative. It keeps the drag-and-drop board Trello is loved for and adds backlog planning, configurable workflows, roles, and time tracking without Power-Ups. Self-hosting is free and unlimited, and the managed cloud starts at $4 a month.",

  honestNote:

      question: "Is Trello open source?",
      answer:
        "No. Trello is proprietary software owned by Atlassian and runs only as a cloud service. Kaneo, WeKan, and Kanboard are MIT-licensed kanban boards whose code you can read, change, and run yourself for free.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you self-host Trello?",
      answer:
        "No. Trello is a hosted Atlassian product with no on-premise edition, so the only way to run a Trello-style board on your own server is to use a different tool. Kaneo, WeKan, Kanboard, and PLANKA are the common self-hosted choices.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best open-source Trello alternative?",
      answer:
        "It depends on how far you expect to grow. WeKan and Kanboard stay close to a pure board. Kaneo adds backlog planning, workflows, roles, time tracking, and an API while keeping the board simple, and it is MIT licensed with SSO included.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I import my Trello boards into Kaneo?",
      answer:
        "There is no one-click Trello importer yet. Trello exports each board to JSON, and Kaneo has a public, documented API you can post those cards to. If you want this as a built-in feature, open an issue on GitHub, since import work is prioritised by demand.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Kaneo free?",
      answer:
        "Self-hosting Kaneo is free forever under the MIT license, with unlimited users and projects and no feature gates. The managed cloud is $4 a month for one person or $5 per user a month for a team, after a 14-day trial.",
