    "Kaneo is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to monday.com. It is MIT licensed, free to run on your own Docker host with unlimited users and boards, and its cloud starts at $4 a month with no seat minimums. monday.com is a broader work-OS with dashboards, forms, and CRM templates that Kaneo does not try to match.",

    "monday.com is a work OS, not just a tracker. If you want dashboards, forms, CRM boards, and a marketplace of apps in one place, and you are happy paying per seat for it, it does far more than Kaneo. Kaneo is for teams who want a fast project tracker they can own.",

      question: "Is there an open-source monday.com alternative?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Kaneo, OpenProject, Leantime, and Plane are all open source and self-hostable. Kaneo is the lightest of them to run: one container plus PostgreSQL, MIT licensed, with SSO included.",

    {
      question: "Can monday.com be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "No. monday.com is cloud-only SaaS. Its Enterprise tier adds security and compliance controls, but there is no version you can install on your own servers.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does monday.com's free plan include?",
      answer:
        "The free plan is capped at 2 seats and 3 boards, with a limited set of views. Paid plans are per seat with minimum seat counts, and SSO arrives at the Enterprise tier.",

      answer:
        "Kaneo has workflow rules per project that map integration events to target columns, plus outgoing webhooks, GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea integrations, and notifications in Slack, Discord, Telegram, and Mattermost. It does not have a general automation recipe builder.",
