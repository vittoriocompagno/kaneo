  subheading:
    "Linear is fast and beautifully focused, but it's closed-source, cloud-only, and you can't run it yourself. Kaneo gives you a clean, focused workflow that's open source and self-hostable.",
  verdict:
    "Kaneo is the closest open-source, self-hostable answer to Linear. It is MIT licensed, runs on your own Docker host, and keeps the same idea of a fast, uncluttered tracker with keyboard-friendly boards, backlog, and workflows. It does not try to reproduce Linear's cycles, triage, or insights.",

    {
      question: "Can Linear be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "No. Linear is a closed-source SaaS product with no self-hosted or on-premise edition. If running the tracker on your own infrastructure is a requirement, you need an open-source tool such as Kaneo, Plane, or Huly.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best open-source Linear alternative?",
      answer:
        "Kaneo, Plane, and Huly are the three usually named. Kaneo is MIT licensed and the smallest of the three to run and understand. Plane is AGPL and larger. Huly is EPL-2.0 and bundles chat, documents, and HR alongside tracking.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Kaneo have keyboard shortcuts and a fast UI?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Kaneo is built as a single-page React app with realtime updates over WebSockets, so boards stay in sync without reloads. It is deliberately smaller in scope than Linear, which is what keeps it quick.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Kaneo pricing compare to Linear?",
      answer:
        "Kaneo is free to self-host with every feature including SSO, and its cloud is $4 a month for one user or $5 per user a month for teams. Linear is priced per user with a free tier capped by issue count, and SSO on its paid plans.",
