  verdict:
    "Kaneo is an open-source, MIT-licensed alternative to Shortcut. Both are built for software teams that want a board, a backlog, and not much ceremony. The difference is that Kaneo can be self-hosted for free with unlimited users, while Shortcut is cloud-only and free only up to 10 users.",

      question: "Can Shortcut be self-hosted?",

        "No. Shortcut is cloud-only SaaS with no on-premise edition, so self-hosting means moving to an open-source tracker such as Kaneo, Plane, or Huly.",
