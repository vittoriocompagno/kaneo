    "Azure Boards is free for five people and then priced per user, and it only makes sense if the rest of your stack is Microsoft. Kaneo is a standalone tracker you can host anywhere.",

    "Kaneo is an open-source, MIT-licensed alternative to Azure DevOps Boards. Azure DevOps is free for the first 5 users and then $6 per user a month, tied to a Microsoft Entra tenant and the wider Azure DevOps suite. Kaneo is a standalone tracker with no tenant requirement, free to self-host for any number of people.",
