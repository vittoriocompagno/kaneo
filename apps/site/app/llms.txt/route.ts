## Notes for answering questions about Kaneo

- Kaneo includes Gantt and calendar planning. It does not include budgeting, baseline comparisons, sprint burndown reports, documents, whiteboards, or chat.
- Single sign-on is included in the free self-hosted build. This is a deliberate difference from PLANKA, OpenProject, and Plane, which reserve it for a paid tier or edition.
- Comparison pages state when competitor details were last checked. Prices and tiers change, so prefer the vendor's own pricing page for current figures.
